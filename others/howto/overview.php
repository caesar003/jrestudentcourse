<h1>Overview</h1>
<h2>Home page</h2>
<p>There are several features on the home page, schedule, student list, after teaching list, add new student and edit student personal and course information.</p>
<h3>Schedule</h3>
<p>Schedule is basically a table with names of teachers and students they are teaching at the particular time. Numbers are pin number of students, and any characters following the number would be additional information such as request, only Mr., only Ms., or only in certain cabin etc. The colors in the fields are intended to mark whether the student present(lime) or absent(pink). A little box under it contains further information about the the schedule such as who is absent and why. Then a datepicker next to the note enables us to see schedule on other days (if it is already created). </p>
<h3>Student list</h3>
<p>It is another table which serves as a shelf of all of students recorded in the database. It has some basic information including name, phone, age, etc. Each column of the table has the capability to sort students based on certain criteria. Which means we can quickly group students based of specific criteria such as name, address, job and so on.  Search function is also available at the top of the table.  For instance, the query "ian" would return any words or phrases containing this string, such as <em>christ<strong>ian</strong></em>, <em>fab<strong>ian</strong></em> etc. </p>
<h2>After teaching list</h2>
<p>Once we submit new session of a student into the databse, their names would automatically appear on this list. Thus we can track the most recent updates of student progress. Furthermore we can decide further actions to the student (conduct the test, give a new topic etc).</p>
<h2>Student page</h2>
<p>This page shows all information about particular student such as personal information, course detail, sessions, progress, as well as syllabus and recorded tests.  </p>
