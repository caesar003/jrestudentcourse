<h1>New Student</h1>
<p>We can register a new student into our list using button above student list. </p>
<img width="100%" src="../others/howto/images/new_student_button.png">
<p>Then our screen would look like this</p>
<img width="100%" src="../others/howto/images/new_student_form.png">
<p>There are several fields that are required to register a new student. They are pin number, complete name, phone number, address, date of birth, study program, and program duration. The rest of them can be left blank and completed later (usually during the first meeting).  </p>

<p>After we fill out all required fields, hit the submit button at bottom of the form. If we do everything correctly, the form would soon disappear and our new added student would be available on the list. </p>
